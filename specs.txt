Technical Test For Javascript (UI) Developer

Good Endpoint: https://athena-7.herokuapp.com/ancients.json
Search Endpoint: https://athena-7.herokuapp.com/ancients.json?search=Ath
Error Endpoint: https://athena-7.herokuapp.com/ancients.json?error=true

Using a JS MVC framework of your choice (or regular Javascript/jQuery), please carry out the following tasks:

1. Consume the good endpoint and display a list of the results on-screen.
2. Display the results in capitals without using CSS transforms.
3. Add search functionality to the UI that uses the search endpoint instead.
4. Take the error endpoint and display the error message it returns.
5. If the search term called a second time then fetch it from a local JS cache rather than hitting the network.


You can style the application in any way that you choose.
If you are unsure of any requirements, then please get in touch.
If you can't solve a problem then please write down how you would approach it and send it on.
Best of luck.
